1,"Friday, August 19,",1:12 PM,"Today, I felt that I’m nothing. Compared to others, I’m just a nobody. I’m a mere tool for their convenience. My opinions are not valued nor considered. I felt so sad today that I cried when the sad music was played. However, after talking to my friend, some sadness was released. However, since I was a child, I hold grudges, unknowingly I carry it up to today. Not knowing what to do, I just go with the flow. #SuperLost #SadMusic #Notmyday",0,0,0,0,0,0

It’s a first time for me to write a chaptered story with one chapter with 2000+ words! It’s a love story, btw.
