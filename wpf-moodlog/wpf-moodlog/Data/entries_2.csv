2,"Saturday, September 3,",9:06 AM,"I’ve been searching the Internet for a tool, package, or API that performs word segmentation. I’ve seen lots but I was faced with problems. I couldn’t run code written in C/C#. I don’t know how to properly install and use the package or API. I couldn’t make sense of the code. But I don’t have enough time to learn how. After hours of searching the Internet, I thought I finally found the right tool with python’s ‘wordsegment’ package. I can run python code, the tool is easy to use, and I can understand the code well. All that’s left is to download the package. But alas, I already consumed my pocket WiFi’s data limit with all my aimless searching earlier. That’s when I decided. I’ll go to the library.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0

But I guess it’s also to commemorate the times we still have together, the times we have left in UST. I can’t believe we will already graduate this year. Time sure flies fast. crying_face Nevertheless, It was unforeseen, a coincidence, that I left the library and was at the back of the UST Main Building the exact moment the fireworks started. I didn’t plan on watching the fireworks. But I was there at the right time. The fireworks were as beautiful and mesmerizing as usual. People gathered and we just looked up at the sky in awe. #USTfireworks",0,0,0,0,0,0

They were accompanied by a woman in a ponytail and they were all playing happily in the rain, holding hands, running, laughing, and free.

8,"Monday, September 5,",11:29 PM,"I went to UST at 9:00AM to meet the seller of a book I wanted to buy. The book was actually for my sister. She studies in another school, but she found the books in UST Book Market much cheaper and convenient. So I went to the designated time and place, notified the seller that I arrived, but no replies. I played 2048 in my phone to kill time. When it’s already 9:15AM, I called the seller. It seems like she forgot about the meeting along with the book. We rescheduled the meeting tomorrow, same time same place. I admit that I’m disappointed at first, but I just thought she might have a lot of things in minds, like schoolwork for example. That’s why she forgot. There are instances when I’m late or I forgot about a meeting myself because of schoolwork. Besides, she was apologetic when I called and even texted me to say sorry.

My friend told me there’s a construction going on there, so the traffic’s really heavy. Me and my three friends met at the benches opposite the Roque Ruano building. We will go to Ocean Park’s #YexelMuseum today. I’m #excited. We rode an FX to Luneta/Rizal Park. The sun and heat is merciless, but I enjoyed the scenery along Luneta/Rizal Park, the statues of Philippine heroes, the open air Auditorium, the various gardens, the kalesas, the marker of Gomburza’s execution site, and of course the noble statue of Rizal at the end and center. I respect the two officers guarding Rizal’s statue and grave. How could they stand straight and still for hours in this scorching heat? It might be difficult, but I can assume they’re proud of their job and honored to be given this opportunity to protect Rizal’s final resting place.  Finally, we arrived at #OceanPark. I can smell the sea from the passing wind. We climb the wide stairs to the entrance. The words ‘Please do not sit on the stairs’ are written on the edge of each step and yet there are still people sitting. Not that I could blame them. The stairs were so wide and after a long, tiring walk it’s a nice place to sit on. While Angel is getting our tickets, Yena and I stood besides watching the Philippine Eagle in its majestic flight. This is my first time seeing a Philippine Eagle in flight. I usually saw them in a cage perched in some branch in a zoo. But now, even from afar, I can clearly see its outstretched brown wings. I wonder how long its wingspan is exactly.  We’re in. The first attraction I saw is the Bird of Prey. It features the Philippine Eagle I glimpsed earlier. I saw souvenirs and pictures of penguins, sea lions, clown fish, jellyfish, and octopus.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0

I don’t know why but these two friends of mine have this treatment to me where i feel ignored, where i feel like they purposely don’t answer my questions. Most times I just think that maybe they don’t hear me, maybe they just don’t bother to answer my question. I just feel that they do not reciprocate what I feel for them. Why do they always say what they want while they don’t listen to what I want to say? Is that really how it is? I don’t know what to do about that. I don’t know why they are like that.
