It’s like we are paying lots and lots of money, just to obtain copies of powerpoint slides for our class. pensive_face. And it’s also very hard to pretend that you’re attentively listening to the reports, when in fact, it’s very hard to focus on them, knowing that you can also find what they are talking about in the powerpoint slides. (Darn it, you’re so bad, Jen. But I’m very sorry; I’m just stating my opinion.) But anyways, all things happen for a reason. I guess, this is one way for me to strengthen my weak interpersonal skills…which is very important in the workplace someday. Let’s look for the light, in the darkness, I guess. I really enjoyed our SCL class earlier, even though, my perfectionist self striked again, when I got 1 mistake in our quiz earlier. pensive_face. Sad, perfectionist life again. But anyways, let’s go back to the enjoyable part of SCL class today. The prof asked us the difference between male and female.

Well, let me tell you, Jenny. It’s very impossible to happen. Stop fantasizing about things, and start focusing on your studies. It feels very stressful to push yourself to achieve something. It’s very tiring, and somehow causes emotional problems, in me. But I have no choice, but to continue it, because it is something that I want to prove myself, prove my family, and prove everyone, that I can do it, even I have made a mistake, and failed once. I hope everyone saying that ‘Don’t push yourself too much’ will understand that I really need to do this. DEEP THOUGHTS. Where am I getting all of these???",0,0,0,0,0,0
