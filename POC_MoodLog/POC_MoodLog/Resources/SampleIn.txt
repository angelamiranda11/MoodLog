I had a roundtrip this morning, from Manila to Bulacan, and Bulacan to Manila. It’s very nice to travel again. And it was also my first time to ride the train in Roosevelt Station. LRT2 feels there. I don’t know why I am very curious on their current status, as if I have the chance if they didn’t make it. Well, let me tell you, Jenny. It’s very impossible to happen. Stop fantasizing about things, and start focusing on your studies.
